# Program for Final Work (1st term)

## Formulated task (translated)
Write a program that, from an existing array of strings, forms an array of strings whose length is less than or equal to 3 characters.

## Input data in program

For fast testing input array already given and has some strings with different number and type of symbols.

## Main steps of written program

1. *Initializing* variables
    1) **Input array**
    2) **Temporary array** borrowing size from **Input array**
    3) **Index j** for temporary array

2. *Printing* to console **Input array**

3. Filtering **input array** from strings that have 4 symbols or more: If string from **input array** include 3 symbols or less then *write* string to **temporary array** and *increase* **index j** +1.

4. *Initializing* **Output array** using (**index j** + 1) as array size

5. *Clearing* **temporary array** from empty strings: **Output array** takes only first strings from **temporary array** using **index j** as number of unemty strings in **temporary array**

6. *Printing* to console **output array**
